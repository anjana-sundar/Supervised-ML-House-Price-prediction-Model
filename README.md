# Bengaluru House Price Prediction 🏠

A supervised machine learning project to predict housing prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Focusing on Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python on large datasets, identifying correlations, handling missing values, managing outliers, encoding techniques, feature selection, model evaluation and visualising insights to improve model accuracy.


## 📌 Problem Statement
The objective is to predict house prices in Bengaluru using clean and processed data, improving the accuracy and interpretability of the results.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: ([Kaggle - Bengaluru House Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishabhr717/bengaluru-house-datacsv))
- Shape: (13320, 9)
- Features: Location, Size, Total Sqft, Bath, Balcony, Price, etc.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering (e.g., location simplification)
- Outlier detection and removal
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables

## 🧠 Model Used
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Train-test split and model evaluation using R² score and MSE

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Clear multicollinearity analysis
- Feature selection improved model performance
- Addressed skewed location data using dimensionality reduction

## 📈 Results
- Mean Squared Error: 4413.675
- R-squared: 0.730196
